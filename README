= Crufty 0.1

Find dead code.  A dumb plugin to find methods that aren't called (or aren't called often).

== Usage

Simple usage:

rake crufty:find_methods DIR=app/models

That will print out a list of methods (and their files) in app/models that aren't called anywhere in app or lib.

Want to find methods that are just called just once?

rake crufty:find_methods DIR=app/models SENSITIVITY=2
